  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <div class="card">
    When you see this page, you have probably just set up linked roles. Congrats!
    <ul>
      <li>You will now have a profile card on the server profile where you connected.</li>
      <li>Whenever you are online on Skribbl, your stats on your profile will refresh automatically.</li>
      <li>If the server has set it up, you can unlock special server roles with your Palantir stats.</li>
      <li>If you want to remove the connection, go to your Discord settings -> Athorized Apps, and deauthorize Palantir.</li>
    </ul>
