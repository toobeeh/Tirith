<h1>Rules and Fair Play</h1>
<h3>How to behave :)</h3>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  Typo and Palantir bring together a variety of different skribbl communities.<br />
  In order to maintain an friendly environment, following rules are to be respected on the Typo server, when using the Palantir Bot or when playing on skribbl.io with the typo extension enabled.
</div>
<br><br>

<h2>Fair Play on skribbl</h2>
Skribbl is pretty much like anarchy, but as a Typo User you are part of a big community of skribbl enthusiasts and should follow a few straightforward guidelines to keep the game fun for everyone.
<br><br>
<h3>Usernames</h3>
When you use typo, there is zero tolerance against usernames containing offensive language, hate speech, or references to controversial figures.
<br>
Usually you will receive a warning first, but this can lead to a ban from typo.
<br><br>
<h3>Behaviour on Skribbl</h3>
Similar as in usernames, discriminating messages or hate speech can lead to a ban from typo, since as a typo user, you are a representation of the typo community.
However, it is important to understand that there is no explicit moderation for content on skribbl, neither from moderators/developers of skribbl.io nor from the typo extension.
<br>
For what it's worth, here's a recommendation to make skribbl a better experience for everyone: Don't be a dick :)<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Fair Play for catching Drops</h2>
Drops are the most competitive aspect of typo and can heat up emotions quickly.<br>
Drops are meant to be caught casually while playing skribbl, but there are still many other valid ways of catching a drop.<br>
Here's a list of Do & Don'ts for catching drops:<br>
<br>
<ol class="list-decimal">
  <li>
    <b>Allowed Devices</b><br>
    You're free to use to use any input device you want - be it a mouse, pen, touch screen or your laptop trackpad.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Drop Position Cheats</b><br>
    There are a few ways to get the drop to appear always at the same position.<br>
    As a rule of thumb, if your catching method gets you to catch the drop always on the same position, it is not allowed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Automated Catches</b><br>
    Using clickers or scripts that catch the drops for you in an automated way will lead to a drop ban with no exceptions.<br>
    Drop catches that are faster than about 190ms will also be automatically rejected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Extra Lobbies to catch Drops</b><br>
    If you want to focus only on catching drops without playing skribbl at all, you can open a private lobby or join a public lobby without any other players.<br>
    However, drops caught in these "idle lobbies" will only count for your drop league stats; not to your bubble credit, event progress or anything shown in your inventory.<br>
    Drops that are caught in those lobbies are colored pink and instead of a ðŸ’Ž, they will have a ðŸ§¿ icon.<br>
    <br>
    Any attempt to bypass this limitations (and still catch drops in a lobby without an actual skribbl game) is not allowed and will lead to a drop ban.
  </li>
</ol><br>

<h3>Receiving a Drop Ban</h3>
Most of the guidelines above can't be automatically detected.<br>
This means, a drop ban is mostly the consequence of suspicious behaviour and user reports.<br>
To avoid reports, unjust bans or if you are unsure about the guidelines, do not hesitate to ask on the server.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, feel encouraged to report suspicious behaviour as soon as possible so that the drop competition can be a fair game for everyone.<br>
<br><br>

<h2>Fair Play for Bubbles</h2>
Bubbles are the currency to buy sprites and scenes.<br>
They are earned automatically when you play skribbl, but there are still a few things you should keep in mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Bubble Farming</h3>
Being in a lobby without playing actual skribbl is considered as bubble farming.<br>
There is no hard limit which amount of bubbles in idle lobbies will give you a bubble farming flag.<br>
Moderators will decide per case; if you are not sure if something you do is okay, you can always ask on the server.<br>
A good rule of thumb is that a bubble farming flag will be handed out when the majority of your total bubbles is from farming, or if a big part of bubbles required for an event scene is farmed.<br>
<br>
<h3>Bubble Farming Flag</h3>
When moderators give you a bubble farming flag, you won't show up in leaderboards and you can't buy event scenes.<br>
If that's fine for you, you can proceed farming bubbles, although it is not recommended.<br>
There may be further restrictions in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Server Behaviour Guidelines</h2>
The "Typo Testground" Discord Server is a community & help server for skribbl - and more specifically - the skribbltypo extension.<br>
Offtopic is welcome, but should not use #general.<br>

Behave adult, be friendly and respectful towards other community members.<br>
Hate speech, racism, sexism, insults, spamming, provocation et cetera are not tolerated on this server in any form - messages, reactions, usernames and profile pictures.<br>
<br>
It's inevitable in big communities that some people don't get along, but dragging conflicts onto the server only makes the community feel uncomfortable and is not allowed.<br>
You can use DMs or other servers/platforms to sort that out, but on the server you are expected to treat every member with the same respect.<br>
If you disagree with something another community member wrote or has done, ignore it or contact the moderators if it violates these guidelines.<br><br>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
For violations, moderators can hand out a "community ban" role which will remove you from all community text channels/forums.<br>
Trying to bypass this, like by quickly rejoining the server, will have a permanent server ban as consequence.<br>
<br>
In general, moderators will give you a heads-up before handing out a ban. Depending on the situation, moderators will give temporary or immediate bans as well.<br>
Moderators will always try to act in the best interest of the server, and their decisions are to be respected.<br>
If there is reason to do so, moderators can also lift a ban that has been given before.<br>
In special cases, moderators can also permanently ban you from using typo/palantir.<br>
