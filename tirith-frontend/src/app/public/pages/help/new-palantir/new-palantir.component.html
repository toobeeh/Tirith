    <h2>Slash Commands</h2>
    <div class="card">
      Every single command is now <b>available as slash command!</b><br>
      It is strongly recommended to use slash commands, because it makes it much more easier for you to find the right command and options for it.<br><br>
      To use a slash command, start typing with a <b>/</b> in a discord server.<br>
      You will see a popup above the chat, where you can find commands of all bots on the server.<br>
      You can either <b>click the profile picture of the Palantir Bot to browse and select one of its commands</b>, or you can continue typing the command name.<br>
      After you have selected the command, you need to fill in options - like a sprite ID or a user mention.<br>
      Discord will guide you through it! When you have filled everything in, hit enter to send the command.<br><br>
      If you prefer text commands, you can use the <b>></b> prefix as well, like in the old palantir.<br> For text commands, there are also command name shortcuts available - you can find them in the help command.

    <h2>New Command Names</h2>
    <div class="card">
      Almost all commands have been reorganized and received new names.<br>
      Commands are now grouped together, to make it easier to use and remember similar commands, like for buying, viewing, and using scenes & sprites.<br><br>
      These are the most important command groups:
      <ul>
        <li><b>sprite</b> - View, buy and use sprites</li>
        <li><b>scene</b> - View, buy and use scenes</li>
        <li><b>event</b> - View your current event stats or browse past events</li>
        <li><b>boost</b> - View and manage splits and dropboosts</li>
        <li><b>award</b> -  View award stats and the award gallery</li>
      </ul><br>
      Each command group has commands in it.<br>
      For example, to view all sprites ("list" command in the sprite group), you have to write <b>/sprite list</b>.

    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>The Help Command</h2>
    <div class="card">
      The new Palantir offers much more help than the "good" old bot.<br>
      To see a list of all commands and groups, use the command <b>/help</b>.<br><br>
      You can get more information about the commands and groups when you specify the command or group name in the help command, here are some examples:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>/help inventory</b> - View help for the "inventory" command</li>
        <li><b>/help sprite</b> - View help for the "sprite" command group</li>
        <li><b>/help sprite use</b> - View help for the "use" command in the "sprite" group.</li>
      </ul><br><br>
      You can also use the find command to quickly search matching commands - like <b>/find use</b>.
    </div>
  </div>

    <h2>Sprite & Scene Commands</h2>
    <div class="card">
      Sprites and scenes are probably the most important thing in Palantir. This is a short summary of the commands.<br><br>
      Sprite command examples:
      <ul>
        <li>View a list of popular sprites: <b>/sprite list</b></li>
        <li>View a sprite with ID 1: <b>/sprite view 1</b></li>
        <li>Buy a sprite with ID 1: <b>/sprite buy 1</b></li>
        <li>Use a sprite with ID 1: <b>/sprite use 1</b></li>
        <li>View your sprite inventory: <b>/sprite inventory</b></li>
        <li>Colorize a sprite with ID 1 with the rainbow color 50: <b>/sprite color 1 50</b></li>
      </ul><br>
      Scene command examples:
      <ul>
        <li>View a list of popular scenes: <b>/scene list</b></li>
        <li>View a scene with ID 1: <b>/scene view 1</b></li>
        <li>Buy a scene with ID 1: <b>/scene buy 1</b></li>
        <li>Use a scene with ID 1: <b>/scene use 1</b></li>
        <li>View your scene inventory: <b>/scene inventory</b></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Drop Boosts</h2>
    <div class="card">
      Drop boosts were a bit reorganized as well.<br>
      The most important thing is that every user has <b>now two more splits available for boosts</b>.<br>
      These two splits are used for the +0.1 standard boost. Don't forget to use them!<br>
      You can also start <b>multiple drop boosts at the same time, or upgrade a drop boost that is currently running or cooling down</b>, if you get more splits afterwards.<br><br>
      Here are some examples:
      <ul>
        <li>View your splits inventory: <b>/boost inventory</b></li>
        <li>Start a new dropboost: <b>/boost start</b></li>
        <li>View your active or cooling-down boosts: <b>/boost cooldown</b></li>
        <li>Extend/upgrade an active boost with ID 1 (found in the cooldown list): <b>/boost upgrade 1</b></li>
      </ul><br>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>More command examples</h2>
