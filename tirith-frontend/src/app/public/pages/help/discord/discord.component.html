    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>You can connect to servers that have palantir - by default, you are connected to the typo discord server.</li>
        <li>Typo tells Palantir when you're online on skribbl and displays it in a channel on your connected servers.</li>
        <li>Palantir shows your lobby, language, points and more on Discord.</li>
        <li>On skribbl, your friends can also join you with just one click.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade your avatar & match with your friends</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>When you are logged in, you are rewarded with "Bubbles" (Palantir's currency) every 10s.</li>
        <li>With those Bubbles, you can buy costumes which display as on your skribbl avatar - these are called "Sprites".</li>
        <li>To get bonus Bubbles to buy more sprites or avatar backgrounds (Scenes), you can catch Drops on the skribbl canvas.</li>
        <li>Once in a while, there are Sprite events for exclusive items.</li>
      </ul>
