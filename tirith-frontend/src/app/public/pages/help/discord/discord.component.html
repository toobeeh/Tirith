<br><br>
<h3>With a typo account, you can customize your skribbl appearance and connect with friends.</h3>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <div class="card">
      Typo is not only an extension that brings many tools that come handy while drawing and guessing.<br>
      When you click on "Login with Palantir", you can create a typo account and start collecting items and connect with friends.<br><br>
      This is what you can do with a typo account, in a nutshell:
      <ul>
        <li>As soon as you play on skribbl, you automatically start collecting "Bubbles", the typo currency.</li>
        <li>You get 1 Bubble every 10s when you're online on skribbl.</li>
        <li>Using bubbles, you can buy avatar decorations ("Sprites"), or avatar backgrounds ("Scenes").</li>
        <li>Every other typo user will see those decorations, when they're playing in the same lobby as yo!</li>
        <li>Once in a while, a drop icon appears on the skribbl canvas. When you click them quickly, you can collect bonus bubbles.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Your Inventory</h2>
    <div class="card">
        To buy and use sprites and scenes, see your stats and do many more things, you can use the "Palantir" Discord bot.<br>
        Join the typo Discord server or invite the bot to your own server using <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1071142417987813376&scope=bot&permissions=2147747840">this link</a>.<br><br>
        The Bot supports many commands to access your  inventory, check progress on seasonal challenges or compete with your friends.<br>
        To see more help about the Bot commands, you can check out <a href="/help/new-palantir">this article</a>.
