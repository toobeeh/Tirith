    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <div class="card">
      When you have a discord server, you can set it up as a <b>typo server home.</b><br>
      This allows other people on your discord server to connect to this server - no one else can connect, so it's private!<br><br>
      On a home server, you have access to a <b>dedicated Palantir Bot.</b><br>
      This Bot will check frequently who of your server members (with a typo account) are online on skribbl.<br>
      If someone is online, <b>it shows their lobby with stats and the lobby link</b> in a discord channel. <br>
      Everyone on the server can quickly join using the lobby link, or with shortcut buttons directly on skribbl.io!<br><br>
      Additionally, you can also see a leaderboard of all connected people, or set up a discord channel to post images directly from skribbl.

    <h2>Set Up Server Home</h2>
    <div class="card">
      To use a server as server home, a typo member with an <b>active patreon subscription has to support the server.</b><br>
      This can be done with the command <b>/patron home</b> anywhere on the server.<br>
      Patrons can select only one server at a time. If it's needed, a different server can be selected after a cooldown of seven days.<br>
      It is possible that more than one member supports a server as server home, but it won't bring additional perks.<br><br>

      As soon as the server is supported by a patreon subscriber, a server admin can <b>invite the Palantir Lobbies Bot</b>.<br>
      The invite link for the bot is shown when the "/patron home" command is used.<br>
      The bot is exclusively for this server and will stay as long as the server is supported by a patreon member.<br><br>

      The last step is to <b>choose a channel on your server</b> where the Lobby Bot will show all lobbies. This has to be done by a server admin.<br>
      The bot creates a message and edits it every 20 seconds. It is recommended to create a new channel, where only the bot can send messages.<br>
      With the command <b>/server lobbies <#channel></b> the bot will start right away to show lobbies!
    </div>

    <h2>Customize the Server Home</h2>
    <div class="card">
      When the setup is completed, you can do a few more things to customize your typo server home.<br><br>
      The Lobby Bot supports the same commands as the public Palantir bot, but for this one you can choose a custom Prefix.<br>
      To set a prefix, a server admin can use the command <b>/server prefix &lt;prefix></b><br><br>
      You can also add an Image Post channel with the command <b>/imagepost add &lt;#channel> &lt;name></b>.<br><br>
      With the command <b>/server info</b> you can always see the details of your server home.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Lobbies Channel</h2>
    <div class="card">
      The Lobbies Channel is the heart of your typo server home.<br>
      It displays all lobbies of connected members and lets others quickly join either by the link or via a join button on skribbl.io.<br><br>
      To be displayed there, <b>members must connect to the server home</b> first - this can be done using the invite link in the Lobbies Channel.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Server Leaderboard</h2>
    <div class="card">
      As soon as the server home is set up, you can use the <b>/leaderboard bubbles</b> command on this server to see a ranking of all connected members, ordered by their bubble amount.<br>
      If you want to rank by drop score, you can use the command <b>/leaderboard drops</b>.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Image Post Channel</h2>
    <div class="card">
      When a server admin has set up an Image Post channel on the server, connected members can quickly send images from skribbl to a server channel.<br><br>
      To send an image, you can then click the letter-icon on skribbl and choose the name of the channel where you want the image to be posted.<br><br>
      Server admins can add an image post channel with the command <b>/imagepost add &lt;#channel> &lt;name></b>. <br>
      The channel option sets the server channel where posted images will appear, and the name option sets the name which users will see on skribbl.<br>
      You can see all image post channels of the server with <b>/imagepost list</b> or remove one with <b>/imagepost remove &lt;name></b>.
