    <h2>Invite & set up the bot</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>You can use Palantir always on the Typo Discord. For privacy reasons, you can also set it up on your own
          server.</li>
        <li>Click the image below to see a complete walkthrough.</li>
        <li>Grant all permissions to ensure proper functionality. <br />If something looks broken... consider setting
          the given perms.</li>
        <li>The bot will create a message and edit it continuously, so the channel should be read-only for members.
        </li>
        <li>Initialize the bot with the command '>observe #channel'.
        </li>
        <li>Use @Palantir instead > due to recent changes.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Troubleshoot</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The Bot does not respond</b><br />
          Sadly, Palantir can't be used with the '>' prefix anymore. <br>
          Instead, message like '@Palantir help'.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>Which commands can i use?</b><br />
          Get available commands with 'help'.<br />
          Only commands which can be executed by the author are shown.<br />
          Every command to change bot settings requires the administrator role permission.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>What is the server token?</b><br />
          The server token is a unique key which lets users see and send lobbies to this server.<br />
          This ensures that the lobbies are only visible to users in the server.<br />
          If the token is changed, users need to enter the new token to be verified again.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>How to change the channel?</b><br />
          The channel can always be set with the command 'observe'.<br />
          If existing, the current bot message will be left as it is and a new one will be created.<br />
          By default, the server token will change.<br />
          If you want to keep the token as it is, call the command 'switch #channel'.
          The command message and bot response with the token can be deleted.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>The bot does not edit the message.</b><br />
          Try to set the channel again.<br />
          If this does not help, contact me on DC @tobeh#7437.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>How can my friends connect to my server?</b><br />
          The bot shows an invite link in the lobby message.<br>
          Your friends can use it to connect to the server.
        </li>
